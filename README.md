# Simple-Word-Cloud - JAVA API
A Simple Word Cloud API that reads text contents from a text file, website and creates an image file (.png) with the most frequently occuring words in large font.
This API can be used in three different ways but all produce the same result.
Before using this API, ensure that you have your stop-words file ready. You will need these to check all the common used words against your Dictionary file and eliminate all the common words from your main dictionary file.
#1. Console
  With this, you will need both the Stop-words file and the Dictionary file in the project directory. Then run the API and follow the      instructions.
#2. Graphical User Interface
  With this, you only have to load you Stop-words file. Then you run the API. You copy your text from any other source and paste in into   the GUI and click the Generate Word Cloud button.
#3. Web Content
  Thia allows you to get text content from any other website. All you have to do is load your Stop-words file, RUN the API. You will be    asked to just type in the URL link for your desired website. The API will pull all the contents from that particlar web page and create   a cloud word based on the most frequent occuring words. This also has GUI functionality that gives you instructions on what do next.
